# Blacklight: Evolution

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Introduction
**Blacklight: Evolution** is a Minecraft mod which is intended to replicate 
the various abilities and effects of Prototype from the video game _**PROTOTYPE**_.

This mod is on a very early stage of development, and many features are yet to be implemented,
and there may be bugs and performance issues.

What's more, the mod is my first GitHub project and Minecraft mod, so it can be seen as my programming learning project.
